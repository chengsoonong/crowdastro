   abstract = {We consider the problem of using queries to learn an unknown concept. Several types of queries are described and studied: membership, equivalence, subset, superset, disjointness, and exhaustiveness queries. Examples are given of efficient learning methods using various subsets of these queries for formal domains, including the regular languages, restricted classes of context-free languages, the pattern languages, and restricted types of propositional formulas. Some general lower bound techniques are given. Equivalence queries are compared with Valiant's criterion of probably approximately correct identification under random sampling.},

Finally, the measure is applied to provide a solution to some problems of experimental design, where the object of experimentation is not to reach decisions but rather to gain knowledge about the world.},

This paper analyzes whether the sentiment expressed in Twitter feeds, which discuss selected companies and their products, can indicate their stock price changes. To address this problem, an active learning approach was developed and applied to sentiment analysis of tweet streams in the stock market domain. The paper first presents a static Twitter data analysis problem, explored in order to determine the best Twitter-specific text preprocessing setting for training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) sentiment classifier. In the static setting, the Granger causality test shows that sentiments in stock-related tweets can be used as indicators of stock price movements a few days in advance, where improved results were achieved by adapting the \{SVM\} classifier to categorize Twitter posts into three sentiment categories of positive, negative and neutral (instead of positive and negative only). These findings were adopted in the development of a new stream-based active learning approach to sentiment analysis, applicable in incremental learning from continuously changing financial tweet streams. To this end, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the best querying strategy for active learning of the \{SVM\} classifier adapted to sentiment analysis of financial tweet streams. The experiments in analyzing stock market sentiments of a particular company show that changes in positive sentiment probability can be used as indicators of the changes in stock closing prices. "

  abstract={Despite the great promise of machine-learning algorithms to classify and predict astrophysical parameters for the vast numbers of astrophysical sources and transients observed in large-scale surveys, the peculiarities of the training data often manifest as strongly biased predictions on the data of interest. Typically, training sets are derived from historical surveys of brighter, more nearby objects than those from more extensive, deeper surveys ( testing data ). This sample selection bias can cause catastrophic errors in predictions on the testing data because (1) standard assumptions for machine-learned model selection procedures break down and (2) dense regions of testing space might be completely devoid of training data. We explore possible remedies to sample selection bias, including importance weighting, co-training, and active learning (AL). We argue that AL—where the data whose inclusion in the training set would most improve predictions on the testing set are queried for manual follow-up—is an effective approach and is appropriate for many astronomical applications. For a variable star classification problem on a well-studied set of stars from Hipparcos and Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, AL is the optimal method in terms of error rate on the testing data, beating the off-the-shelf classifier by 3.4% and the other proposed methods by at least 3.0%. To aid with manual labeling of variable stars, we developed a Web interface which allows for easy light curve visualization and querying of external databases. Finally, we apply AL to classify variable stars in the All Sky Automated Survey, finding dramatic improvement in our agreement with the ASAS Catalog of Variable Stars, from 65.5% to 79.5%, and a significant increase in the classifier's average confidence for the testing set, from 14.6% to 42.9%, after a few AL iterations.}

   abstract ={In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ∼105 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour–magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology.},

abstract="At very low frequencies, the new pan-European radio telescope LOFAR is opening the last unexplored window of the electromagnetic spectrum for astrophysical studies. The revolutionary APERTIF- phased arrays that are about to be installed on the Westerbork radio telescope (WSRT) will dramatically increase the survey speed for the WSRT. Combined surveys with these two facilities will deeply chart the northern sky over almost two decades in radio frequency from ∼15 up to 1400 MHz. Here we briefly describe some of the capabilities of these new facilities and what radio surveys are planned to study fun-damental issues related to the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. In the second part we briefly review some recent observational results directly showing that diffuse radio emission in clusters traces shocks due to cluster mergers. As these diffuse radio sources are relatively bright at low frequencies, LOFAR should be able to detect thousands of such sources up to the epoch of cluster formation. This will allow addressing many question about the origin and evolution of shocks and magnetic fields in clusters. At the end we briefly review some of the first and very preliminary LOFAR results on clusters.",

  abstract ={Cross-matching catalogues at different wavelengths is a difficult problem in astronomy, especially when the objects are not point-like. At radio wavelengths, an object can have several components corresponding, for example, to a core and lobes. Considering not all radio detections correspond to visible or infrared sources, matching these catalogues can be challenging. Traditionally, this is done by eye for better quality, which does not scale to the large data volumes expected from the next-generation of radio telescopes. We present a novel automated procedure, using Bayesian hypothesis testing, to achieve reliable associations by explicit modelling of a particular class of radio-source morphology. The new algorithm not only assesses the likelihood of an association between data at two different wavelengths, but also tries to assess whether different radio sources are physically associated, are double-lobed radio galaxies, or just distinct nearby objects. Application to the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic and Australia Telescope Large Area Survey CDF-S catalogues shows that this method performs well without human intervention.},

  abstract ={We have discovered a previously unreported poor cluster of galaxies (RGZ-CL J0823.2+0333) through an unusual giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy found in the Radio Galaxy Zoo project. We obtained a spectroscopic redshift of z = 0.0897 for the E0-type host galaxy, 2MASX J08231289+0333016, leading to Mr = −22.6 and a 1.4 GHz radio luminosity density of L1.4 = 5.5 × 1024 W Hz−1. These radio and optical luminosities are typical for wide-angle tailed radio galaxies near the borderline between Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classes I and II. The projected largest angular size of ≈8′ corresponds to 800 kpc and the full length of the source along the curved jets/trails is 1.1 Mpc in projection. X-ray data from the XMM-Newton archive yield an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of the thermal emission surrounding RGZ J082312.9+033301 at 1.2 − 2.6 × 1043 erg s−1 for assumed intra-cluster medium temperatures of 1.0 − 5.0 keV. Our analysis of the environment surrounding RGZ J082312.9+033301 indicates that RGZ J082312.9+033301 lies within a poor cluster. The observed radio morphology infers that (a) the host galaxy is moving at a significant velocity with respect to an ambient medium like that of at least a poor cluster, and that (b) the source may have had two ignition events of the active galactic nucleus with 107 yrs in between. This reinforces the idea that an association between RGZ J082312.9+033301 and the newly discovered poor cluster exists.},
