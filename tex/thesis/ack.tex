    I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Cheng Soon Ong, for his invaluable
    guidance, advice, and commentary throughout the Honours year. I would also
    like to thank Dr Julie Banfield for her help with both the thesis and
    project itself, and for answering all of my many astronomy questions.
    Finally, I would like to thank Jacob Buete, Damon Binder, and Rachel Alger,
    who gave up their time to read and comment upon the draft of this thesis.
