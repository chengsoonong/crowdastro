\chapter{Radio Cross-identification}
\label{cha:cross-identification}

  In this chapter, we develop a machine learning approach to the radio cross-%
  identification problem. First, we discuss different ways to train and use
  a classifier for the task, in particular framing the cross-identification
  problem as an object localisation problem. We then discuss the available
  training data and how we chose to process it. Finally, we present results
  against a dataset of expert labels, and compare these results to those found
  by other methods.

\section{Formalism}
\label{sec:cross-identification-formalism}

  We begin by restating the cross-identification problem (Section
  \ref{sec:radio-cross-identification}). When we look at the sky with radio
  telescopes, we see the radio emissions from the jets of AGNs. Given an image
  of these radio emissions, and possibly other images in other wavelengths, we
  want to locate the host galaxy containing the associated AGN. In general,
  there may be multiple hosts associated with one radio object (such as in
  Figure \ref{fig:two-hosts}), but we make the assumption that there is only
  one. This greatly simplifies the problem.

  \begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption{A radio object (ARG0003ra1) with two host galaxies. This radio
      object is actually two radio objects that have been incorrectly detected
      as one, and there is one host galaxy for each object.}
    \label{fig:two-hosts}
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Cross-identification as Object Localisation}
  \label{sec:object-localisation}

    We can interpret cross-identification as an object localisation problem. As
    input, we have an image of the radio sky, and we want to locate a host
    galaxy in this image. A common way to find an object in an image is by using
    a sliding window. A fixed-size image patch centred on each pixel is taken as
    a representation of that pixel. This is then used as input to a
    classification model which outputs a probability for each pixel, with higher
    probabilities corresponding to higher likelihood of the object being located
    at that pixel. The pixel with the highest probability is considered the
    location of the object.

    This may be slow depending on the size of the image. One way to improve upon
    this approach is to first identify a small number of candidate locations,
    and then only examine patches around these locations. For the cross-%
    identification problem, we can use galaxy locations as candidate pixels,
    with galaxies found in infrared surveys such as WISE and SWIRE.
    Additionally, astronomical measurements such as magnitude are included in
    these surveys and these may be taken as additional features for each
    candidate pixel, giving more information to the classifier.

  \subsection{The Galaxy Classification Task}
  \label{sec:galaxy-classification-task}

% \section{Cross-identification as Binary Classification}
% \label{sec:framing-as-classification}

  This approach can be formalised as follows. Consider a set $\mathcal X$ of
  candidate host galaxies, and a radio object $r$ that we want to assign a
  host galaxy. Let $y : \mathcal X \to \{0, 1\}$ represent whether a given $x
  \in \mathcal X$ is the host galaxy associated with $r$. Under the assumption
  that a radio object has exactly one associated host galaxy, then there exists
  exactly one $x \in \mathcal X$ such that $y(x) = 1$, and for all other $x \in
  \mathcal X$, $y(x) = 0$. The cross-identification task then amounts to
  modelling $p(y(x) = 1 \mid x, r)$. Once this distribution is modelled, the
  host galaxy associated with $r$ is given by
  \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:cross-identification}
      \mbox{host}(r) = \underset{x}{\mbox{argmax}}\ p(y(x) = 1 \mid x, r).
  \end{equation}

  Ideally, $\mathcal X$ is the set of all galaxies. This is clearly
  intractable, so as an approximation we use a catalogue of infrared objects
  near the radio object of interest, taken from an infrared survey. We also
  make the assumption that the host galaxy is within $1'$ of the radio object
  --- while this doesn't hold in general, systems larger than $1'$ are rare and
  require human insight to discover \citep{banfield16}.

\section{Evaluating Performance Without Groundtruth}
  \label{sec:norris-as-groundtruth}

  In general, we do not have groundtruth for the cross-identification problem.
  While the groundtruth exists (a galaxy either has an AGN or does not), it is
  impossible for us to measure this accurately. Even expert catalogues, such as
  those provided by \citeauthor{norris06} (Section \ref{sec:norris}), are noisy
  --- \citep{norris06} estimate that their cross-identifications have a $9.02\%$
  false positive rate.
  
  Our primary source of labels for the classification task is the Radio Galaxy
  Zoo. These labels have been provided by non-experts, and as such are even more
  noisy. This leads to two problems: A classifier trained on the noisy labels
  may be inaccurate, and evaluating the performance of a trained classifier
  against noisy labels will not accurately reflect the true performance of the
  classifier. We address the former in Section \ref{sec:rgz-crowd-labels}, and
  the latter here.

  The obvious way to evaluate classifier performance without groundtruth is to
  aggregate the Radio Galaxy Zoo crowd labels in some way to approximate the
  groundtruth, and then use that for evaluation. While there are many ways that
  we could aggregate the labels (Section \ref{sec:rgz-crowd-labels}), these
  aggregates are \emph{not} the groundtruth and may still contain high noise. We
  want our classifier to be capable of finding the best approximation to the
  groundtruth, not to the noisy inputs, and evaluation should reflect that. We
  therefore cannot use aggregated crowd labels for evaluation.

  To attempt to mitigate this problem, we combined the \citeauthor{norris06}
  catalogue (Section \ref{sec:norris}) with the \citeauthor{fan15} catalogue
  (Section \ref{sec:fan}) to obtain a test set with as little noise as possible.
  Each galaxy identified as hosting an AGN in the catalogues was matched to the
  nearest WISE or SWIRE object. Each matched object was then labelled $1$. All
  other galaxies in the infrared survey were labelled $0$. This produced two
  label sets, which we refer to as the \citeauthor{norris06} labels and the
  \citeauthor{fan15} labels respectively. We then took the intersection of these
  label sets to find a set of galaxies for which the label sets agree. Test sets
  were drawn only from this set of galaxies. This results in a test set where
  test instances are ``easier'' than a test set drawn from the entire data set,
  but any tests performed against these test sets should be more reliable than
  would otherwise be the case.

\section{Experiment Design}
\label{sec:experiment-design}

  To guide our classifier design, we needed to run experiments. This section
  describes the design and test sets used for the experiments that appear in the
  following sections.

  To generate the \citeauthor{norris06} and \citeauthor{fan15} label sets, we
  matched each location identified by \citeauthor{norris06} and
  \citeauthor{fan15} to the nearest candidate host in WISE. These galaxies were
  labelled $1$. All other candidate hosts were labelled $0$.

  We generated test sets by first finding all candidate hosts for which the
  \citeauthor{norris06} label and the \citeauthor{fan15} label agree. To
  generate a test set, we followed the following method:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Find all ATLAS objects where \citeauthor{norris06} and
    \citeauthor{fan15} agree on the labels of all galaxies within 1'.
    \item Draw randomly without replacement 50\% of the ATLAS objects.
    \item If a candidate host is within 1' of a drawn ATLAS object, add it to
    the test set.
  \end{enumerate}
  This method resulted in a test set with similar class distribution to the true
  data and no feature overlap between training objects and testing objects. We
  drew 10 test sets with this method.

  To train and test a method, we followed the following method:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose a test set.
    \item Add all candidate hosts not in this test set to the training set.
    \item Train the method using the selected training set.
    \item Evaluate performance with balanced accuracy against the test set.
    \item Repeat for all other test sets.
  \end{enumerate}
  We report the mean balanced accuracy and standard deviation.

\section{Feature Selection}
\label{sec:features}

  To train a machine learning method to solve the galaxy classification task,
  we must find a representation of galaxies in a feature space $\mathbb{R}^D$.
  In this section we describe and motivate our choice of galaxy features,
  extracted from both infrared and radio surveys.

  \subsection{Infrared Features}
  \label{sec:ir-features}

    \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/wise_colour-colour}
      \caption{WISE colour-colour diagram showing the colours of various
        astronomical objects. The horizontal axis is $w2 - w3$ and the vertical
        axis is $w1 - w2$. Reproduced from \citep{wright10}.}
      \label{fig:wise-colour-colour}
    \end{figure}

    As described in Section \ref{sec:cross-identification-formalism}, we need
    candidate host galaxies from an infrared catalogue. We have two choices here
    --- the WISE catalogue (Section \ref{sec:wise}) and the SWIRE catalogue
    (Section \ref{sec:swire}). WISE is lower resolution and less sensitive, but
    is the survey that will be used to cross-identify EMU (Section
    \ref{sec:emu}) sources when they are available. SWIRE has higher
    resolution and sensitivity, and thus would give more accurate galaxies, but
    it does not cover the whole sky. Here, we describe our choice of features
    for both.

    For WISE, we chose to use all four WISE band magnitudes ($w1, w2, w3,$ and
    $w4$) as features. Since the features are magnitudes, they are on a
    logarithmic scale, and we found that in practice classification performance
    improved when the magnitudes were converted to their corresponding flux
    value. We performed this conversion with the formula
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:mag-to-flux}
      f = 10^{-0.4m}.
    \end{equation}
    This is the inverse of Equation \ref{eq:apparent-magnitude} with the flux in
    linear units of $f_{\text{Vega}}$ Jy.

    The ratios between infrared fluxes are indicators of physical galactic
    properties such as star formation and dust \todo{Find a source on this ---
    Probably the WISE paper wright10}. In practice, the $w1 - w2$ and $w2 - w3$
    ratios are most commonly used (such as in Figure
    \ref{fig:wise-colour-colour}), so we chose to use these ratios as features.
    Once again, we used a linear scale, computing the ratios using equation
    \ref{eq:magnitude-difference} and converting them to linear units with
    Equation \ref{eq:mag-to-flux}.

    Also available were the unprocessed infrared images captured in the survey.
    Under the assumption that the large scale infrared structure of a galaxy is
    unchanged by an AGN, we chose to ignore the images themselves and focus on
    features obtained from the catalogue. This greatly simplified feature
    selection with minimal expected impact on the classification performance.
    Future work may investigate the effectiveness of features extracted from
    infrared images on classification performance, but this is out of the scope
    of this thesis.

    SWIRE also contains colour information, but unlike WISE, the information is
    in the form of fluxes instead of magnitudes. This means that the flux
    information in the catalogue can be used as features directly. The ratios
    can also be used --- $3.6\ \mu\text{Jy} / 4.5\ \mu\text{Jy}$ and $4.5\
    \mu\text{Jy} / 5.8\ \mu\text{Jy}$ are the SWIRE equivalents of $w1 - w2$ and
    $w2 - w3$. Since SWIRE is higher resolution than WISE, the
    infrared images may contain more useful information and thus be useful for
    features, but this was not explored in this thesis.

    % The SWIRE catalogue (Section \ref{sec:swire}) also contains colour
    % information for each contained object, but only fluxes rather than
    % magnitudes. \todo{Read the SWIRE colour-colour diagram and continue this.}

    % Both WISE and SWIRE catalogues contain the positions of each object. The
    % distance from each object to the centre of the closest radio object is
    % used as a feature representing that object. This noticeably improves
    % classification performance \todo{make an experiment showing this, and
    % probably also showing that the other features are good}.

  \subsection{Radio Features}
  \label{sec:radio-features}

    While the infrared catalogues include measurements on individual galaxies,
    the ATLAS radio catalogue does not. This is because galaxies are not
    visible in radio, so while galaxies are directly represented in an infrared
    catalogue they are not in a radio catalogue. Galactic features must thus be
    extracted from the radio images directly. We chose to use a convolutional
    neural network, as described in Section \ref{sec:image-feature-extraction}.

    \subsubsection{Building a Model for Feature Extraction}
    \label{sec:feature-extraction-model}

      \begin{figure}[!ht]
         \centering
         \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/cnn_new.pdf}
         \caption{Convolutional neural network for radio feature extraction. The
           leftmost square represents the input image; the rightmost rectangle
           is the output.}
         \label{fig:radio-cnn}
       \end{figure}

      We chose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) with three
      convolutional and max pooling layers, shown in Figure \ref{fig:radio-cnn}.
      This resulted in an 128-dimensional feature vector. For training this
      network, we added a 64-dimensional dense layer mapping to a 1-dimensional
      output. 10\% of ATLAS objects were selected at random and reserved for
      training the CNN, to ensure later testing data would not overlap the
      training set. The entire network was then trained to match the consensus
      Radio Galaxy Zoo labels of the galaxies nearest the reserved training set.

      A better approach would be to use a convolutional autoencoder, which would
      allow training on all the radio data, and data with no labels at all, but
      this was computationally infeasible for this project.

      An example of the neural network applied to a radio image is shown in
      Figure \ref{fig:rgz-cnn}.

          left-most image is the original radio image. The other images are the
          32 images output from each of the three convolutional layers.}
        \label{fig:rgz-cnn}
      \end{figure}

  \subsection{Feature Analysis}
  \label{sec:feature-analysis}

    To determine the effect of each set of features on classification
    performance, we performed a feature ablation experiment. We trained a
    logistic regression classifier on the \citeauthor{norris06} label set, each
    time using a different subset of features. The lower the resulting balanced
    accuracy, the more important the held out features. This was repeated ten
    times with different $50\%$ subsets of the training set. When holding out
    the WISE magnitude features, we also held out the CNN features, since we
    found that the CNN features tended to dominate results. These results are
    plotted in Figure \ref{fig:feature-ablation} and the means and standard
    deviations of the balanced accuracies can be found in Table
    \ref{tab:feature-ablation}.

        rows are sorted from highest accuracy to lowest.}

\section{Choosing a Binary Classifier}
\label{sec:binary-classifiers}
  
  \begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/experiments/lr_rf}
    \caption{Comparison of logistic regression and random forests on the galaxy
      classification task, trained on the \citet{norris06} and \citet{fan15}
      label sets, and tested against the \citet{norris06} label set.}
  \end{figure}

  To compare the performance of logistic regression with random forests on the
  galaxy classification task, we performed the following experiment. We first
  generated five test sets of WISE objects. Then, using all other WISE objects
  as a training set, we trained a logistic regression classifier with $L2$
  regularisation for each test set, first using labels from \citet{norris06},
  and separately using labels from \citet{fan15}. We then computed the balanced
  accuracy for each classifier. This was repeated for random forests, with each
  tree using $\sqrt{D}$ features.

  To generate the test sets, we first selected at random half of all ATLAS
  objects. We then added all WISE objects within $1'$ of a selected ATLAS object
  to the test set. This was repeated for each test set. The motivation for first
  selecting ATLAS objects rather than drawing WISE objects directly is that WISE
  objects have overlapping features, since radio features are taken from a patch
  of sky centred on each object, and WISE objects tend to be close together.
  Objects from the test sets were then removed at random until all test sets
  were the same size.

    \begin{tabular}{r|c}
      \textbf{Method(Training Set)} & \textbf{Mean Balanced Accuracy (\%)}\\\hline
      Raykar(Top-15-prolific) & $46.34 \pm 18.45$\\
      LR(Top-15-prolific-MV) & $51.98 \pm 3.87$\\
      Raykar(Top-15-accurate) & $86.43 \pm 0.10$\\
      LR(Top-15-accurate-MV) & $86.76 \pm 1.01$\\
      Raykar(Top-15-est-accurate) & $87.25 \pm 0.74$\\
      LR(Top-15-est-accurate-MV) & $87.25 \pm 0.90$\\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Comparison of logistic regression and \citeauthor{raykar10} on the
      galaxy classification task with different numbers of labellers.}
    \label{tab:rgz-raykar}
  \end{table}

  While we want to train a classifier on the crowdsourced labels from the Radio
  Galaxy Zoo, it is unclear how we should aggregate the labels. Some methods for
  aggregation are described in Section \ref{sec:crowd-labels}. Which method will
  perform best on a dataset is dependent on the dataset itself, so we tested
  both variants of the \citeauthor{raykar10} algorithm and majority vote on the
  galaxy classification task.

  One key problem with the use of the \citeauthor{raykar10} algorithm is that it
  is very slow with large numbers of labellers. To mitigate this problem, we
  tested the algorithm on a subset of labellers, chosen by three different
  measures: the 10 labellers with the most labels, the 10 labellers with the
  highest balanced accuracy assessed against the \citeauthor{norris06} labels,
  and the 10 labellers with the highest balanced accuracy assessed against the
  majority vote of all labellers. While in practice on datasets such as EMU or
  FIRST there would be no equivalent to the \citeauthor{norris06} labels, we can
  treat this test as a ``best-case'' method. For each subset of labellers, the
  \citeauthor{raykar10} algorithm was tested against logistic regression trained
  on the majority vote of just these labellers. The results are shown in Figure
  \ref{fig:rgz-raykar} and Table \ref{tab:rgz-raykar}.

  With $T = 10$ labellers, the \citeauthor{raykar10} algorithm took $83 \pm 36$
  seconds to run. When the number of labellers was increased to $T = 15$, the
  \citeauthor{raykar10} algorithm took $152 \pm 115$ seconds to run. This helps
  to highlight how slow the algorithm becomes with increasing $T$.

  We also tried using all of the crowd labels directly with logistic regression,
  without aggregation. In principle, training logistic regression on such a
  label set may ``average'' over the conflicting labels and give reasonable
  results. This was not the case in practice; we found that this method resulted
  in a balanced accuracy of $50\%$ (i.e. random chance) as the classifier
  learned to always output 0.

  We trained logistic regression classifiers on three training sets:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the \citeauthor{norris06} labels,
    \item the \citeauthor{fan15} labels, and
    \item the Radio Galaxy Zoo majority vote.
  \end{itemize}
  We also trained the \citeauthor{raykar10} algorithm with the Radio Galaxy Zoo
  labels. Each volunteer was assigned a unique index and the algorithm was run
  with the best $T = 50$ labellers, computed against the Radio Galaxy Zoo
  majority vote. Finally, we compared the predictions of all classifiers to the
  Radio Galaxy Zoo majority vote. These results are plotted in Figure
  \ref{fig:predictors} and shown in Table \ref{tab:predictors}. The average
  confusion matrices normalised by class size are shown in

  % The classifier was then used to classify the objects in the testing set. The
  % labels were compared to those found by \citet{norris06} as described in
  % Section \ref{sec:norris}, resulting in $80.14\%$ balanced accuracy.
