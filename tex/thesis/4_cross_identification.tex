\chapter{Radio Cross-identification}
\label{cha:passive-learning}
  % In this chapter I'll talk about a machine learning approach to the cross-identification problem (i.e. my pipeline).

  In this chapter, I develop a machine learning approach to the radio cross-identification problem. First, I will discuss the available training data and how I chose to process it. Then, I will discuss different ways to train and use a classifier for the task, in particular framing the cross-identification problem as an object localisation problem. Finally, I will present results against a dataset of expert labels, and compare these results to those found by other methods.
