\chapter{Galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei}
\label{cha:astro}

    Modern astronomy relies on observations of deep space in different
    wavelengths, with different wavelengths each carrying different physical
    meanings. Infrared surveys detect star formation and dust in distant
    galaxies, and radio surveys detect massive objects called active galactic
    nuclei. In this section, we describe what we see in radio and infrared
    surveys, as well as introducing specific radio and infrared surveys relevant
    to this thesis. We also discuss the motivation behind cross-identifying
    active galactic nuclei with their host galaxies, as well as the inherent
    difficulty in doing so, and hence provide the motivation for this thesis.

    \section{Astronomical Observations}
    \label{sec:astronomical-observations}

        When observing the sky, we can think about the sky as being projected
        onto a spherical surface surrounding the earth. All objects we see with
        telescopes are flat on the sky, and we only have limited tools to
        determine their distances and scales. In this section, we describe the
        coordinate systems and units used to describe these objects.

        \subsection{Astronomical Coordinates}
        \label{sec:coordinates}

            \begin{figure}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/ra-dec}
                \caption{The equatorial coordinate system used in astronomy.}
                \label{fig:equatorial-coordinates}
            \end{figure}

            Astronomy uses the \emph{equatorial coordinate system} to describe
            the positions of objects on the sky. Each position on the sky is
            described by two numbers: the \emph{right ascension} (RA) and the
            \emph{declination} (dec).

            The right ascension of an object is the angle eastward from the
            vernal equinox to the object along the celestial equator. It is
            measured in hours (h), minutes (min), and seconds (s). There are 60
            seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 1 hour is equal to 15
            degrees. Right ascension ranges between 0h and 24h, where both 0h
            and 24h are located at the vernal equinox. The declination of an
            object is the angle northward from the celestial equator to the
            object. It is measured in degrees (${}^\circ$), arcminutes ($'$),
            and arcseconds ($"$). Declination ranges between $-90^\circ$ and
            $90^\circ$, where $-90^\circ$ is the declination of the south
            celestial pole and $90^\circ$ is the declination of the north
            celestial pole. The right ascension and declination are shown in
            Figure \ref{fig:equatorial-coordinates}. It is important to note
            that while right ascension and declination are both measured in
            minutes and seconds, these are \emph{different} minutes and seconds.
            1 minute (right ascension) is equal to 15 arcminutes (declination).

            Objects are usually given a International Astronomical Union (IAU)
            name based on their coordinates. This name includes the catalogue
            that identified the object, the right ascension, and the
            declination. For example, ATLAS3 J002925.7-440256C is from the third
            release of the ATLAS catalogue, and is located at 00h 29m 25.7s
            $-44^\circ$ $02'$ $56"$.

        \subsection{Wavelength and Frequency}
        \label{sec:wavelength}

            Light is an electromagnetic wave, and like all waves it has
            \emph{wavelength} and \emph{frequency}. The wavelength of light is
            the distance between two neighbouring peaks; it is measured in
            metres (m) and usually denoted $\lambda$. The frequency of light is
            the number of waves per second; it is measured in hertz (Hz) and
            usually denoted $\nu$. Wavelength and frequency are related by the
            formula
            \[
                c = \lambda \nu,
            \]
            where $c$ is the speed of light.

            Humans can see a limited range of wavelengths of light. In this
            range, the wavelength of light corresponds to its colour: Blue light
            has shorter wavelength (and higher frequency) than red light.
            Outside of this range, light still has various different
            ``colours'', but we cannot see them. Different ranges of wavelength
            are assigned different names, such as infrared, x-ray, and radio.

            When objects emit light, the wavelength depends on the process by
            which the light was emitted. For example, thermal radiation is
            emitted by all objects based entirely on the temperature of the
            object, with hotter objects emitting light with shorter wavelengths.
            Another example is synchrotron radiation (Section \ref{sec:agns}),
            which is emitted in radio wavelengths.

            Since telescopes generally only detect brightnesses of objects in
            the sky, and different wavelengths of radiation require different
            mechanisms to detect, telescopes are designed to measure radiation
            only at specific ranges of wavelengths. Separate measurements of
            wavelength are later combined for analysis.

        \subsection{Flux and Magnitude}

            The \emph{flux density} of an object is its energy output per unit
            time per unit area. It is denoted $f$ and is measured in $\text{W
            m}^{-2}$. The flux density is given by
            \[
                f = \frac{1}{A}\frac{\text{d}E}{\text{d}t}
            \]
            where $E$ is the energy received from the object and $t$ is the
            time. We cannot usually measure the flux over all frequencies, so
            usually flux is observed over a specific frequency range $\Delta
            \nu$. The \emph{spectral flux density} is then the limit of this as
            the frequency range approaches zero, i.e.
            \[
                f_\nu = \frac{1}{A}\frac{\text{d}^2E}{\text{d}\nu\text{d}t}
            \]
            where $A$ is the area of the object on the sky. The spectral flux
            density is measured in janskys (Jy), an astronomical unit equal to
            $10^{-26} \text{ W m}^{-2} \text{ Hz}^{-1}$ \citep{francis08}.

            The \emph{apparent magitude}, $m$, of an object is a logarithmic
            measure of its apparent brightness seen from Earth, relative to the
            star Vega \citep{francis08}. The difference between the magnitudes
            of two objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$, represents the logarithm of the
            ratio of their flux densities
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq:magnitude-difference}
                m_2 - m_1 = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_2}{f_1}\right)
            \end{equation}
            and so the apparent magnitude is given by
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq:apparent-magnitude}
                m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f}{f_{\text{Vega}}}\right)
            \end{equation}
            where $f$ is the flux density of the object and $f_{\text{Vega}}$ is
            the flux density of Vega, measured at the same frequency.

    \section{Radio Active Galactic Nuclei}
    \label{sec:agns}

        \begin{figure}[!ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[height=0.2\textheight]
                {images/accretion_disk_artist_impression.jpg}
            \caption{An artist's impression of the accretion disk of an active
                galactic nucleus. \emph{Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech}}
            \label{fig:accretion-disk}
        \end{figure}

        Many galaxies contain a supermassive black hole in their centre
        \citep{richstone98}. These black holes may accrete matter from the
        surrounding galaxy in an \emph{accretion disk} (Figure
        \ref{fig:accretion-disk}). The accretion process emits huge amounts of
        light through different physical processes. These light-emitting black
        holes are called active galactic nuclei (AGNs). AGNs can be extremely
        bright, emitting up to $10^{39}$ J of energy every second --- nearly a
        thousand times more energy than our entire galaxy emits
        \citep{begelman84}. AGNs are found throughout the universe: The closest
        known AGN is Centaurus A (Figure \ref{fig:centaurus-a}), with a distance
        of around $2.4 \times 10^{20}$ km, and AGNs have been detected up to
        redshifts of $z \approx 7$ \citeme \todo{Convert this into a
        non-redshift distance}.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{images/M87_jet.jpg}
            \caption{M87, a giant elliptical galaxy with a jet. \emph{Image:
                NASA and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)}}
            \label{fig:m87}
        \end{figure}

        Around 10\% of AGNs produce \emph{jets} from their accretion disk
        \citep{fabian99}. Jets are long, thin streams of matter such as the one
        shown in Figure \ref{fig:m87}. These jets can be very large, with
        ``giant'' AGNs emitting jets nearly $1$ Mpc ($3 \times 10^{19}$ km) in
        length \citep{saripalli05}.

        Electrons in jets produce \emph{synchrotron radiation}. This is a
        form of radiation emitted by charged particles travelling at
        relativistic speeds as they accelerate in a magnetic field
        \citep{sokolov67}. Synchrotron radiation is emitted in radio
        wavelengths, and so AGNs emitting synchrotron radiation are called
        \emph{radio AGNs}. As radio AGNs are the focus of this thesis, ``AGN''
        will refer only to radio AGNs unless otherwise specified.

        \begin{figure}

                \caption{FIRSTJ093244.5+161050.}
                \label{fig:first-triple}
            \end{subfigure}%
            ~
            \begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}

            \end{subfigure}%
            \caption{Two radio AGNs imaged by the NRAO Very Large Array.}
            \label{fig:first-agn}
        \end{figure}

        We can observe the jets of radio AGNs with radio telescopes, such as in
        Figure \ref{fig:first-agn}. The jets may appear to be separate objects,
        and there may or may not be a radio source in the middle of the AGN
        system. If the system is composed of two separate objects such as in
        Figure \ref{fig:first-double} (one object for each lobe of the jets),
        then it is called a \emph{radio double}; if a central source is also
        visible, then it is called a \emph{radio triple}.

        Since these jets are not point-like sources
        of light, and viewing the jets is the only way to observe radio AGNs,
        common astronomical problems such as cross-identification (Section
        \ref{sec:radio-cross-identification}) can be very difficult, as the true
        location of the AGN is unclear.
        % Most of the radio objects that we have seen in radio surveys conducted
        % so far are these jets \citep{norris11}. Since these jets are the only
        % way to observe radio AGNs, radio AGNs do not appear at all in surveys
        % at other wavelengths.

        % An important part of astronomical surveys is matching objects 

        % To fully understand these objects astronomers need data from more than
        % just radio surveys. Combining observations of objects in multiple
        % wavelengths is therefore a common problem in astronomy, and is called
        % \emph{cross-identification} \citep{fan15}. For point sources of light
        % this can be straightforward --- the coordinates of each source on the
        % sky are well-known and can often be immediately matched throughout
        % surveys --- but as it is the jets of AGNs that emit radio, AGNs are not
        % point sources. We discuss this in detail in Section
        % \ref{sec:radio-cross-identification}.

    \section{Radio Surveys}
    \label{sec:radio-surveys}

        A \emph{survey} is an image of the sky made with repeated observations
        in specific wavelengths, aiming to comprehensively cover some large area
        of the sky. In this section we look at EMU and ATLAS, two surveys in
        radio wavelengths that are relevant to this thesis.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/skymap2.pdf}
            \caption{A map of the sky, showing the FIRST and EMU radio surveys,
                and the SWIRE infrared survey. The ATLAS radio survey
                covers both the CDFS and ELAIS-S1 fields. The WISE infrared
                survey covers the entire sky.}
        \end{figure}

        \subsection{EMU: Evolutionary Map of the Universe}
        \label{sec:emu}

            The largest existing radio survey is currently the NRAO VLA Sky
            Survey (NVSS) \citep{condon98}, which covers the entire northern sky
            as far south as $-40^\circ$. However, NVSS has low sensitivity, only
            detecting objects brighter than $2.5$ mJy. NVSS also has relatively
            low resolution, only resolving objects to $45''$. The most sensitive
            existing radio survey is of the Lockman hole \citep{owen08}, which
            only covered around $0.1$ square degrees of the sky, but detected
            objects as dim as $0.015$ mJy with an angular resolution of $1.6''$.
            The Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) is an upcoming deep radio
            survey that aims to provide both high sensitivity and wide coverage
            of the radio sky \citep{norris11}. EMU will be sensitive to objects
            to around $0.015$ mJy with an angular resolution of around $10''$,
            and cover the entire southern sky as far north as $30^\circ$. The
            survey is expected to find huge numbers of radio objects --- while
            the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey [ATLAS] (which has similar
            resolution and sensitivity to EMU) has detected around 4000 radio
            objects, EMU is expected to find \emph{70 million}
            \citep{banfield15}. Such a large number of detected objects will
            make analysis of the data considerably more difficult than analysis
            of existing surveys has been. Analysis of EMU will be impossible by
            hand, and will therefore require algorithms to process the data.
            With so many new objects it is likely that many objects will not fit
            existing models, meaning that model-based approaches to data
            processing may be ineffective. It is this problem that motivates the
            development of new, machine-learned algorithms for processing
            astronomical data at these large scales. While the EMU survey data
            is not yet released, development of such algorithms can begin by
            looking at other datasets with similar sensitivity and resolution,
            such as ATLAS (Section \ref{sec:atlas}).

            EMU aims to fulfil a number of scientific goals, including:
            \begin{itemize}
                \setlength\itemsep{0 pt}
                \item investigating the evolution of galaxies and supermassive
                    black holes,
                \item exploring the large-scale structure and cosmology of the
                    universe,
                \item developing a catalogue of radio objects in the southern
                    sky,
                \item looking for never-before-seen astronomical objects, and
                \item testing strategies for dealing with data from the upcoming
                    Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope.
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{ATLAS: The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey}
        \label{sec:atlas}

            \begin{figure}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,]{images/CDFS_bitmap}
                \caption{ATLAS observations of CDFS.
                    Reproduced from \citet{franzen15}.}.
                \label{fig:cdfs}
            \end{figure}

            The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) is a high
            sensitivity radio survey which aims to help understand the evolution
            of early galaxies \citep{norris06}. The Australia Telescope Compact
            Array was used to image two small areas of the sky: the Chandra Deep
            Field South (CDFS), and the European Large Area ISO Survey - South 1
            (ELAIS-S1) field. CDFS and ELAIS-S1 are areas of the sky with few
            nearby objects, meaning that observations in these fields are of
            very old, distant objects. These fields in particular were chosen
            because they are the two fields imaged in the Spitzer Wide-area
            Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE, Section \ref{sec:swire})
            visible from the southern hemisphere. SWIRE produced high-resolution
            infrared images of its fields, allowing all objects detected in the
            ATLAS radio images to be cross-identified with their infrared
            counterparts.

            ATLAS is considered a pilot survey for EMU. EMU and ATLAS image the
            same wavelengths with similar resolution and sensitivity, so tools
            and methods developed to process and interpret ATLAS data are
            expected to work well on the data produced by EMU.

            ATLAS provides both a catalogue of detected radio objects and a
            radio image of the CDFS and ELAIS-S1 fields. The CDFS image covers a
            total area of 3.7 square degrees and the ELAIS-S1 image covers a
            total area of 2.7 square degrees. The CDFS image is shown in Figure
            \ref{fig:cdfs}. The catalogue is a list of all objects detected in
            the images with a peak or integrated flux more than 5 times the
            background noise levels. For each object, the catalogue lists
            \begin{itemize}
                \setlength\itemsep{0 pt}
                \item an survey identifier,
                \item an IAU name,
                \item a position on the sky of the peak flux,
                \item a peak flux density,
                \item an integrated flux density,
                \item an angular size,
                \item whether the object is extended or compact, and
                \item a spectral index,
            \end{itemize}
            as well as uncertainties associated with each measurement
            \citep{franzen15}.

            The ATLAS survey of the CDFS field is the focus of experiments in
            this thesis, for three main reasons. It contains around 2400
            objects, providing enough training data for machine learning
            methods, but still remaining a manageable size for our
            resource-limited tests. As a pilot survey for EMU, we expect methods
            developed on ATLAS to also work on EMU. Finally, we have three sets
            of cross-identifications for ATLAS-CDFS (see Sections
            \ref{sec:radio-cross-identification} and
            \ref{sec:radio-galaxy-zoo}), allowing us to check the performance of
            methods we develop.

            The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is an orbital
            infrared telescope. In 2009--2010 it was used to survey the entire
            sky in four wavelengths: 3.4 $\mu$m, 4.6 $\mu$m, 12 $\mu$m, and 22
            $\mu$m. These wavelengths are referred to as WISE bands $w1$, $w2$,
            $w3$, and $w4$, respectively. WISE images have resolutions of
            $6''$--$12''$, with sensitivity between $0.08$ and $6$ mJy,
            corresponding to the detection of sources between $16.5$ and $7.9$
            magnitude \citep{wright10}.

            The AllWISE catalogue \citep{cutri13} is the most recent WISE
            catalogue. For each object detected, the catalogue includes the
            magnitudes in each WISE band, as well as a number of other features
            we do not make use of in this thesis. We will refer to the
            magnitudes in each band by the names of the bands (i.e. $w1$ --
            $w4$).

            The main goal of WISE was to provide a map of the whole sky in
            infrared wavelengths for many different reasons: infrared
            measurements may be used to detect and classify distant galaxies,
            measurements can be cross-identified to complement other surveys,
            and so on. There are many other scientific goals of WISE; these are
            described in detail by \citet{wright10}.

                    of the sky as the WISE image in Figure \ref{fig:wise}.}
            \end{figure}

            The Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) is an
            infrared survey of seven fields of the sky
            \citep{lonsdale03}. These fields --- ELAIS-S1, ELAIS-N1, ELAIS-N2,
            Lockman, CDFS, and Lonsdale --- are called the \emph{SWIRE fields},
            totalling 63.2 square degrees in area. ELAIS-S1 and CDFS are in the
            southern sky; all other fields are in the northern sky. SWIRE is a
            multi-wavelength survey, observing at four wavelengths: 3.6 $\mu$m,
            4.5 $\mu$m, 5.8 $\mu$m, and 8.0 $\mu$m.

            While SWIRE covers far less area of the sky than WISE, it does so at
            considerably higher resolution and sensitivity: $1.2''$ and
            $7.3$--$32.5$ $\mu$Jy, respectively
            \citep{irac-pocket-guide, surace05}.

            SWIRE aimed to investigate the evolution of galaxies and AGNs and
            the relationship between galaxies and AGNs \citep{surace05}.

    \section{Radio Cross-identification}
    \label{sec:radio-cross-identification}

        % \subsection{Motivation}
        % \label{sec:cross-identification-motivation}

        Observations of astronomical objects in different wavelengths give us
        information on different physical properties of the objects. We can only
        make use of this information, however, if we can match observations of
        the same object in different surveys. This is called
        \emph{cross-identification}.

        The specific cross-identification task we focus on in this thesis is
        that of cross-identifying a radio object with its infrared counterpart.
        Most often in current radio surveys, a radio object will be a jet from
        an AGN \citep{norris11}. In this case, we refer to the infrared
        counterpart as the \emph{host galaxy} of the AGN. In this thesis we will
        assume that all radio objects are AGNs.
        The main goal of cross-identifying AGNs is to better understand the
        relationship between AGNs and star-forming activity in their host
        galaxies \citep{norris06}.

        Sometimes, cross-identification is easy: We may have point-like sources
        of light, and we can simply overlay two surveys and identify overlapping
        objects. In the case of cross-identifying radio AGNs, though, we do not
        have point-like sources of light, and cross-identification can be very
        difficult. AGN jets may be arbitrarily large and complex, and often show
        up as multiple disconnected radio objects. As such, past attempts to
        cross-identify radio objects have required human insight
        \citep{norris06,fan15}.

        In this section, we look at two different ways astronomers have
        cross-identified radio objects in the CDFS field of the ATLAS survey. We
        will make use of the resulting catalogues later in this thesis.

        % While we cannot observe the black holes of AGNs directly, we can observe
        % the radio emissions from their jets. These could then be matched to the
        % galaxies hosting the black holes, allowing us to learn more about the
        % galaxy, the black hole, and the surrounding environment. These host
        % galaxies are not visible in radio wavelengths,

        \subsection{Norris et al. Catalogue}
        \label{sec:norris}

            Along with a catalogue of radio objects found in the CDFS field by
            the ATLAS survey, \citet{norris06} produced a catalogue of
            cross-identifications of these radio objects. The catalogue lists
            ATLAS objects and their corresponding SWIRE objects.

            The cross-identification process was semi-automated.
            \citeauthor{norris06} first matched each ATLAS object to the nearest
            SWIRE object. After this step, around half of the radio objects were
            matched to a SWIRE object within $1''$, and $79\%$ were matched to a
            SWIRE object within $3''$. Radio objects greater than $3''$ away
            from a SWIRE object were then cross-identified manually; radio
            doubles and radio triples were matched to the SWIRE object nearest
            their centre.

            Additionally, \citeauthor{norris06} found between 8 and 22 radio
            objects with no identifiable host galaxy in the infrared. These are
            called ``infrared-faint'' radio objects.

            \citeauthor{norris06} estimated the probability of false cross-
            identifications by displacing all radio objects by $1'$ and
            repeating the cross-identification process. From the results of this
            test, they estimated that $9.02\%$ of the cross-identifications are
            false.

            We consider these cross-identifications \emph{expert} cross-
            identifications, i.e., they are the best possible cross-
            identifications available for radio objects in the CDFS field.
            Throughout this thesis, we will use these as an approximation to the
            unobservable groundtruth cross-identifications.

        \subsection{Fan et al. Catalogue}
        \label{sec:fan}

            \citet{fan15} developed an automated cross-identification algorithm
            that fits astronomical models of AGNs to the radio sky.

            The algorithm examines each infrared object in turn. Under the
            assumption that the infrared object is a host galaxy, it then
            searches in a $2'$ radius for potential radio components of AGN
            jets. The radio components with highest likelihood according to a
            Bayesian model are selected using a greedy algorithm.

            This method has some clear limitations --- it is model-based, and
            thus may fail for unexpected radio objects like those we might find
            in EMU, and it is not able to cross-identify infrared-faint radio
            objects. Nevertheless, it performs very well when applied to the
            ATLAS-CDFS field, making 564 cross-identifications identically to
            \citeauthor{norris06}, missing 31 cross-identifications that
            \citeauthor{norris06} reported, and cross-identifying an additional
            62 radio objects.

            In this thesis, we consider the \citeauthor{fan15}
            cross-identifications of ATLAS-CDFS as an alternative source of
            expert cross-identifications, due to the high (but not total)
            agreement with \citeauthor{norris06}.

            \label{fig:rgz-interface}
        \end{figure}

    The \citeauthor{norris06} catalogue is highly accurate, but manual expert
    cross-identification of radio surveys is impractical for large surveys. The
    CDFS field examined by \citeauthor{norris06} only contains around 2400 radio
    objects, which is small even compared to existing surveys (e.g. Faint Images
    of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) \citep{becker95} found
    946~000 radio sources). Automated algorithms such as \citeauthor{fan15}
    scale better, but most such algorithms are still in their infancy
    \citeauthor{norris16} and many are model-based, potentially missing many
    sources that do not fit the models. The Radio Galaxy Zoo project
    \citep{banfield15} provides a different approach: Allow many non-expert
    volunteers to manually cross-identify radio sources with their infrared host
    galaxies.

    Radio Galaxy Zoo is a website where volunteers are presented with a radio
    image from ATLAS or FIRST and a corresponding infrared image from SWIRE or
    WISE, and are tasked with matching the radio source with its host galaxy, as
    well as identifying which radio objects are associated with the same host
    galaxy (e.g., two radio objects may represent two jets of one AGN). To help
    reduce noise in these matches, each compact radio object is shown to 5
    volunteers, and each complex radio object is shown to 20 volunteers. While
    both the cross-identification task and the radio object association task are
    astronomically interesting, we focus only on the cross-identification task
    for this thesis. An example of the workflow presented to volunteers is shown
    in Figure \ref{fig:rgz-interface}.

    Since its launch in December 2013, the Radio Galaxy Zoo project has labelled
    over 100~000 radio objects. One particularly notable result is the discovery
    of one of the largest known wide-angled tail AGNs by two volunteers, which
    would be impossible to detect in current automated algorithms
    \citep{banfield16}.

    The Radio Galaxy Zoo dataset contains around 177~000 images from FIRST, and
    2400 images of the CDFS field from ATLAS. The ATLAS images of the ELAIS-S1
    field are not included, and may be used as a testing set for
    cross-identification algorithms trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo in the
    future. Each image is a 2 arcminute-wide square.

    The cross-identifications are stored in a MongoDB database as a collection
    of associated radio objects and the corresponding pixel locations of the
    volunteers' clicks, as well as the right ascension and declination of the
    radio object. The radio and infrared image patches associated with each
    radio object are also included alongside the database. For detailed analysis
    of these labels, see \citet{atlas-ml}.

    In this thesis, we will train machine learning algorithms to perform the
    cross-identification task trained on ATLAS-CDFS labels from the Radio Galaxy
    Zoo.

%     Radio Galaxy Zoo volunteers are first asked to select combinations of
%     radio objects that correspond to one radio source, and are then asked to
%     select the location of the corresponding host galaxy \citep{banfield15}.
%     Each radio subject is labelled by multiple volunteers. These labels are
%     then collated as follows. First, the most common combination of radio
%     objects is selected, and all labels that have a different combination are
%     discarded. This radio combination is called the consensus radio
%     combination. Then, the density of host location labels is estimated using
%     Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE), and the highest density location
%     is selected. This is called the consensus host location. The consensus
%     host location is then matched to the nearest infrared object.

%     An alternative way to find the consensus host location is by using a
%     clustering algorithm such as $k$-means. Host locations are clustered and
%     the cluster containing the most locations is taken to represent the
%     consensus; the consensus location is then the mean of the cluster. This is
%     faster and more robust than using KDE, but requires $k$ to be known. $k$
%     can be estimated using an algorithm such as PG-means \citep{hamerly07} or
%     by choosing $k$ to minimise some information criterion
%     \todo{cite:sklearn}. The consensus labels for the data associated with
%     this thesis were found in this way, fitting a Gaussian mixture model to
%     the host locations with the number of Gaussians chosen to minimise the
%     Bayesian information criterion.

%     Repeated volunteer labelling helps to reduce noise in the labels. This is
%     necessary as the volunteers are not experts, and may incorrectly label the
%     subject. The hope is that the majority of volunteers will correctly label
%     subjects, which seems to be the case for radio subjects where more than
%     75\% of volunteers agree \citep{banfield15}. The number of times a radio
%     subject is shown to different volunteers is called the redundancy. The
%     redundancy is 5 if the subject is a compact source, and 20 for all other
%     sources. These numbers were chosen based on the redundancy levels of the
%     original Galaxy Zoo project [Banfield, personal communication] \todo{Is
%     this how to cite personal communication? Alternatively, is this written
%     down somewhere?}. Since labels with radio combinations that disagree with
%     the consensus are discarded, the redundancy is usually lower in practice
%     when finding the host location. This can lead to very low redundancy input
%     to KDE, causing KDE to fail. This failure can usually be caught, but the
%     existing solution in this case is to take the mean of all host locations.
%     This is not the consensus host location in general. Another effect is that
%     since more complex sources have higher levels of disagreement in the radio
%     combination stage, more complex sources have more discarded volunteer
%     labels, and thus lower redundancy --- so more complex sources have more
%     noise in their labels.
