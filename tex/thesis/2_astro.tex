\chapter{Galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei}
\label{cha:astro}

    Modern astronomy relies on observations of deep space. Telescopes image the
    sky in different wavelengths, with different wavelengths each carrying
    different physical meanings. Infrared surveys detect star formation and dust
    in distant galaxies, and radio surveys detect massive objects called active
    galactic nuclei. In this section, we describe what in radio and infrared
    surveys, as well as introducing specific radio and infrared surveys relevant
    to this thesis. We also discuss the motivation behind cross-identifying
    active galactic nuclei with their host galaxies, as well as the inherent
    difficulty in doing so, and hence provide the motivation for this thesis.

    \section{Astronomical Observations}
    \label{sec:astronomical-observations}

        When observing the sky, we can think about the sky as being projected
        onto a spherical surface surrounding the earth. All objects we see with
        telescopes are flat on the sky, and we only have limited tools to
        determine their distances and scales. In this section, we describe the
        coordinate systems and units used to describe these objects.

        \subsection{Astronomical Coordinates}
        \label{sec:coordinates}

            Astronomy uses the \emph{equatorial coordinate system} to describe
            the positions of objects on the sky. Each position on the sky is
            described by two numbers: the \emph{right ascension} (RA) and the
            \emph{declination} (dec).

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/ra-dec}
                \caption{The equatorial coordinate system used in astronomy.}
                \label{fig:equatorial-coordinates}
            \end{figure}

            The right ascension of an object is the angle eastward from the
            vernal equinox to the object along the celestial equator. It is
            measured in hours (h), minutes (min), and seconds (s). There are 60
            seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 1 hour is equal to 15
            degrees. Right ascension ranges between 0h and 24h, where both 0h
            and 24h are located at the vernal equinox. The declination of an
            object is the angle northward from the celestial equator to the
            object. It is measured in degrees (${}^\circ$), arcminutes ($'$),
            and arcseconds ($"$). Declination ranges between $-90^\circ$ and
            $90^\circ$, where $-90^\circ$ is the declination of the south
            celestial pole and $90^\circ$ is the declination of the north
            celestial pole. The right ascension and declination are shown in
            Figure \ref{fig:equatorial-coordinates}. It is important to note
            that while right ascension and declination are both measured in
            minutes and seconds, these are \emph{different} minutes and seconds.
            1 minute (right ascension) is equal to 15 arcminutes (declination).

            Objects are usually given a International Astronomical Union (IAU)
            name based on their coordinates. This name includes the catalogue
            that identified the object, the right ascension, and the
            declination. For example, ATLAS3 J002925.7-440256C is from the third
            release of the ATLAS catalogue, and is located at 00h 29m 25.7s
            $-44^\circ$ $02'$ $56"$.

        \subsection{Wavelength and Frequency}
        \label{sec:wavelength}

            Light is an electromagnetic wave, and like all waves, it has
            \emph{wavelength} and \emph{frequency}. The wavelength of light is
            the distance between two neighbouring peaks; it is measured in
            metres (m) and usually denoted $\lambda$. The frequency of light is
            the number of waves per second; it is measured in hertz (Hz) and
            usually denoted $\nu$. Wavelength and frequency are related by the
            formula
            \[
                c = \lambda \nu,
            \]
            where $c$ is the speed of light.

            Humans can see a limited range of wavelengths of light. In this
            range, the wavelength of light corresponds to its colour: Blue light
            has shorter wavelength (and higher frequency) than red light.
            Outside of this range, light still has various different
            ``colours'', but we cannot see them. Different ranges of wavelength
            are assigned different names, such as infrared, x-ray, and radio.

            When objects emit light, the wavelength depends on the process by
            which the light was emitted. For example, thermal radiation is
            emitted by all objects based entirely on the temperature of the
            object, with hotter objects emitting light with shorter wavelengths.
            Another example is synchrotron radiation (Section \ref{sec:agns}),
            which is emitted in radio wavelengths.

            Since telescopes generally only detect brightnesses of objects in
            the sky, and different wavelengths of radiation require different
            mechanisms to detect, telescopes are designed to measure radiation
            only at specific ranges of wavelengths. Separate measurements of
            wavelength are later combined for analysis.

        \subsection{Flux and Magnitude}

            The \emph{flux density} of an object is its energy output per unit
            time per unit area. It is denoted $f$ and is measured in $\text{W
            m}^{-2}$. The flux density is given by
            \[
                f = \frac{1}{A}\frac{\text{d}E}{\text{d}t}
            \]
            where $E$ is the energy received from the object and $t$ is the
            time. We cannot usually measure the flux over all frequencies, so
            usually flux is observed over a specific frequency range $\Delta
            \nu$. The
            \emph{spectral flux density} is then the limit of this as the
            frequency range approaches zero, i.e.
            \[
                f_\nu = \frac{1}{A}\frac{\text{d}^2E}{\text{d}\nu\text{d}t}
            \]
            where $A$ is the area of the object on the sky. The spectral flux
            density is measured in janskys (Jy), an astronomical unit equal to
            $10^{-26} \text{ W m}^{-2} \text{ Hz}^{-1}$ \citep{francis08}.

            The \emph{apparent magitude}, $m$, of an object is a logarithmic
            measure of its apparent brightness seen from Earth, relative to the
            star Vega \citep{francis08}. The difference between the magnitudes
            of two objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$, represents the logarithm of the
            ratio of their flux densities
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq:magnitude-difference}
                m_2 - m_1 = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_2}{f_1}\right)
            \end{equation}
            and so the apparent magnitude is given by
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq:apparent-magnitude}
                m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f}{f_{\text{Vega}}}\right)
            \end{equation}
            where $f$ is the flux density of the object and $f_{\text{Vega}}$ is
            the flux density of Vega, measured at the same frequency.

    \section{Radio Surveys}
    \label{sec:radio-surveys}

        A \emph{survey} is an image of the sky made with repeated observations
        in specific wavelengths, aiming to comprehensively cover some large area
        of the sky. In this section we look at EMU and ATLAS, two surveys in
        radio wavelengths that are relevant to this thesis.

        \begin{figure}[!ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/skymap2.pdf}
            \caption{A map of the sky, showing the FIRST and EMU radio surveys,
                and the SWIRE infrared survey. The ATLAS radio survey
                covers both the CDFS and ELAIS-S1 fields. The WISE infrared
                survey covers the entire sky.}
        \end{figure}

        \subsection{EMU: Evolutionary Map of the Universe}
        \label{sec:emu}

            The largest existing radio survey is currently the NRAO VLA Sky
            Survey (NVSS) \citep{condon98}, which covers the entire northern sky
            as far south as $-40^\circ$. However, NVSS has low sensitivity, only
            detecting objects brighter than $2.5$ mJy. NVSS also has relatively
            low resolution, only resolving objects to $45''$. The most sensitive
            existing radio survey is of the Lockman hole \citep{owen08}, which
            only covered around $0.1$ square degrees of the sky, but detected
            objects as dim as $0.015$ mJy with an angular resolution of $1.6''$.
            The Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) is an upcoming deep radio
            survey that aims to provide both high sensitivity and wide coverage
            of the radio sky \citep{norris11}. EMU will be sensitive to objects
            to around $0.015$ mJy with an angular resolution of around $10''$,
            and cover the entire southern sky as far north as $30^\circ$. The
            survey is expected to find huge numbers of radio objects --- while
            the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey [ATLAS] (which has similar
            resolution and sensitivity to EMU) has detected around 4000 radio
            objects, EMU is expected to find \emph{70 million}
            \citep{banfield15}. Such a large number of detected objects will
            make analysis of the data considerably more difficult than analysis
            of existing surveys has been. Analysis of EMU will be impossible by
            hand, and will therefore require algorithms to process the data.
            With so many new objects it is likely that many objects will not fit
            existing models, meaning that model-based approaches to data
            processing may be ineffective. It is this problem that motivates the
            development of new, machine-learned algorithms for processing
            astronomical data at these large scales. While the EMU survey data
            is not yet released, development of such algorithms can begin by
            looking at other datasets with similar sensitivity and resolution,
            such as ATLAS (Section \ref{sec:atlas}).

            EMU aims to fulfil a number of scientific goals, including:
            \begin{itemize}
                \setlength\itemsep{0 pt}
                \item investigating the evolution of galaxies and supermassive
                    black holes,
                \item exploring the large-scale structure and cosmology of the
                    universe,
                \item developing a catalogue of radio objects in the southern
                    sky,
                \item looking for never-before-seen astronomical objects, and
                \item testing strategies for dealing with data from the upcoming
                    Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope.
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{ATLAS: The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey}
        \label{sec:atlas}

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,]{images/CDFS_bitmap}
                \caption{ATLAS observations of CDFS.
                    Reproduced from \citet{franzen15}.}.
                \label{fig:cdfs}
            \end{figure}

            The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) is a high
            sensitivity radio survey which aims to help understand the evolution
            of early galaxies \citep{norris06}. The Australia Telescope Compact
            Array was used to image two small areas of the sky: the Chandra Deep
            Field South (CDFS), and the European Large Area ISO Survey - South 1
            (ELAIS-S1) field. CDFS and ELAIS-S1 are areas of the sky with few
            nearby objects, meaning that observations in these fields are of
            very old, distant objects. These fields in particular were chosen
            because they are the two fields imaged in the Spitzer Wide-area
            Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE, Section \ref{sec:swire})
            visible from the southern hemisphere. SWIRE produced high-resolution
            infrared images of its fields, allowing all objects detected in the
            ATLAS radio images to be cross-identified with their infrared
            counterparts.

            ATLAS is considered a pilot survey for EMU. EMU and ATLAS image the
            same wavelengths with similar resolution and sensitivity, so tools
            and methods developed to process and interpret ATLAS data are
            expected to work well on the data produced by EMU.

            ATLAS provides both a catalogue of detected radio objects and a
            radio image of the CDFS and ELAIS-S1 fields. The CDFS image covers a
            total area of 3.7 square degrees and the ELAIS-S1 image covers a
            total area of 2.7 square degrees. The CDFS image is shown in Figure
            \ref{fig:cdfs}. The catalogue is a list of all objects detected in
            the images with a peak or integrated flux more than 5 times the
            background noise levels. For each object, the catalogue lists
            \begin{itemize}
                \setlength\itemsep{0 pt}
                \item an survey identifier,
                \item an IAU name,
                \item a position on the sky of the peak flux,
                \item a peak flux density,
                \item an integrated flux density,
                \item an angular size,
                \item whether the object is extended or compact, and
                \item a spectral index,
            \end{itemize}
            as well as uncertainties associated with each measurement
            \citep{franzen15}.

    \section{Infrared Surveys}
    \label{sec:infrared-surveys}

        \subsection{WISE: Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}
        \label{sec:wise}

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]
                    {images/WISE_3h30m05.24s-28d34m46.3s.png}
                \caption{Patch of the WISE multi-wavelength composite image
                    centred on 3h30m05.24s -28d34m46.3s.}
                \label{fig:wise}
            \end{figure}

            The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is an orbital
            infrared telescope. In 2009--2010 it was used to survey the entire
            sky in four wavelengths: 3.4 $\mu$m, 4.6 $\mu$m, 12 $\mu$m, and 22
            $\mu$m. These wavelengths are referred to as WISE bands $w1$, $w2$,
            $w3$, and $w4$, respectively. WISE images have resolutions of
            $6''$--$12''$, with sensitivity between $0.08$ and $6$ mJy,
            corresponding to the detection of sources between $16.5$ and $7.9$
            magnitude \citep{wright10}.

            The AllWISE catalogue \citep{cutri13} is the most recent WISE
            catalogue. For each object detected, the catalogue includes the
            magnitudes in each WISE band, as well as a number of other features
            we do not make use of in this thesis. We will refer to the
            magnitudes in each band by the names of the bands (i.e. $w1$ --
            $w4$).

            The main goal of WISE was to provide a map of the whole sky in
            infrared wavelengths for many different reasons: infrared
            measurements may be used to detect and classify distant galaxies,
            measurements can be cross-identified to complement other surveys,
            and so on. There are many other scientific goals of WISE; these are
            described in detail by \citet{wright10}.

        \subsection{SWIRE: Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic Survey}
        \label{sec:swire}

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/swire_small.jpg}
                \caption{Patch of the SWIRE multi-wavelength composite image
                    centred on 3h30m05.24s -28d34m46.3s. This is the same region
                    of the sky as the WISE image in Figure \ref{fig:wise}.}
            \end{figure}

            The Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) is an
            infrared survey of seven fields of the sky
            \citep{lonsdale03}. These fields --- ELAIS-S1, ELAIS-N1, ELAIS-N2,
            Lockman, CDFS, and Lonsdale --- are called the \emph{SWIRE fields},
            totalling 63.2 $\deg^2$ in area. ELAIS-S1 and CDFS are in the
            southern sky; all other fields are in the northern sky. SWIRE is a
            multi-wavelength survey, observing at four wavelengths: 3.6 $\mu$m,
            4.5 $\mu$m, 5.8 $\mu$m, and 8.0 $\mu$m.

            While SWIRE covers far less area of the sky than WISE, it does so at
            considerably higher resolution and sensitivity: \todo{Find
            resolution of SWIRE} and $7.3 - 32.5$ $\mu$Jy, respectively.

            SWIRE aimed to investigate the evolution of galaxies and AGNs and
            the relationship between galaxies and AGNs \citep{surace05}.

    \section{Radio Active Galactic Nuclei}
    \label{sec:agns}

        Many galaxies contain a supermassive black hole in their centre \citeme.
        These black holes accrete matter from the surrounding galaxy in an
        \emph{accretion disk} (Figure \ref{fig:accretion-disk}). The accretion
        process emits huge amounts of light through different physical
        processes. These light-emitting black holes are called active galactic
        nuclei (AGNs). AGNs can be extremely bright, emitting up to $10^{39}$ J
        of energy every second --- nearly a thousand times more energy than our
        entire galaxy emits \citep{begelman84}. AGNs are found throughout the
        universe: The closest known AGN is Centaurus A (shown in Figure
        \ref{fig:centaurus-a}), with $z \approx 0.0018$, and AGNs have been
        detected up to redshifts of $z \approx 7$ \citeme \todo{Convert this
        into a non-redshift distance}.

        \begin{figure}

            \label{fig:m87}
        \end{figure}

        AGNs produce \emph{jets} from their accretion disk. Jets are long, thin
        streams of matter such as the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:m87}. These
        jets can be very long, with ``giant'' AGNs emitting jets nearly 1 Mpc in
        length \citep{saripalli05}. The process through which jets are emitted
        is currently unknown \citeme.

        Electrons in jets can produce \emph{synchrotron radiation}. This is a
        form of radiation emitted by charged particles travelling at
        relativistic speeds as they accelerate in a magnetic field \citeme.
        Synchrotron radiation is emitted in radio wavelengths, and so AGNs
        emitting synchrotron radiation are called \emph{radio AGNs}. As radio
        AGNs are the focus of this thesis, from this point on ``AGN'' will refer
        only to radio AGNs.

        To fully understand these objects astronomers need data from more than
        just radio surveys. Combining observations of objects in multiple
        wavelengths is therefore a common problem in astronomy, and is called
        \emph{cross-identification} \citep{fan15}. For point sources of light
        this can be straightforward --- the coordinates of each source on the
        sky are well-known and can often be immediately matched throughout
        surveys --- but as it is the jets of AGNs that emit radio, AGNs are not
        point sources. We discuss this in detail in Section
        \ref{sec:radio-cross-identification}.

    \section{Radio Cross-identification}
    \label{sec:radio-cross-identification}

        \subsection{Motivation}
        \label{sec:cross-identification-motivation}

        The main goal of cross-identifying AGNs is to better understand the
        relationship between AGNs and star-forming activity in their host
        galaxies \citep{norris06}.

        While we cannot observe the black holes of AGNs directly, we can observe
        the radio emissions from their jets. These could then be matched to the
        galaxies hosting the black holes, allowing us to learn more about the
        galaxy, the black hole, and the surrounding environment. These host
        galaxies are not visible in radio wavelengths,

        \subsection{Norris et al. Catalogue}
        \label{sec:norris}

            Along with a catalogue of radio objects found in the CDFS field by
            the ATLAS survey, \citet{norris06} produced a catalogue of
            cross-identifications of these radio objects. The catalogue lists
            ATLAS objects and their corresponding SWIRE objects.

            The cross-identification process was semi-automated.
            \citeauthor{norris06} first matched each ATLAS object to the nearest
            SWIRE object. After this step, around half of the radio objects were
            matched to a SWIRE object within $1''$, and $79\%$ were matched to a
            SWIRE object within $3''$. Radio objects greater than $3''$ away
            from a SWIRE object were then cross-identified manually; radio
            doubles \todo{define} and radio triples \todo{define} were matched
            to the SWIRE object nearest their centre.

            \citeauthor{norris06} estimated the probability of false cross-
            identifications by displacing all radio objects by $1'$ and
            repeating the cross-identification process. From the results of this
            test, they estimated that $9.02\%$ of the cross-identifications are
            false.

            We consider these cross-identifications \emph{expert} cross-
            identifications, i.e., they are the best possible cross-
            identifications available for radio objects in the CDFS field.
            Throughout this thesis, we will use these as an approximation to the
            unobservable groundtruth cross-identifications.

    The \citeauthor{norris06} catalogue is highly accurate, but manual expert
    cross-identification of radio surveys is impractical for large surveys. The
    CDFS field examined by \citeauthor{norris06} only contains around 2400 radio
    objects, which is small even compared to existing surveys (e.g. FIRST
    \citep{becker95} found 946 000 radio sources). Automated algorithms such as
    \citeauthor{fan15} scale better, but most such algorithms are still in their
    infancy \citeauthor{norris16} and many are model-based, potentially missing
    many sources that do not fit the models. The Radio Galaxy Zoo project
    \citep{banfield15} provides a different approach: Allow many non-expert
    volunteers to manually cross-identify radio sources with their infrared host
    galaxies.

    Radio Galaxy Zoo is a website where volunteers are presented with a radio
    image from ATLAS or FIRST and a corresponding infrared image from SWIRE or
    WISE, and are tasked with matching the radio source with its host galaxy, as
    well as identifying which radio objects are associated with the same host
    galaxy (e.g., two radio objects may represent two jets of one AGN). While
    both the cross-identification task and the radio object association task are
    astronomically interesting, we focus only on the cross-identification task
    for this thesis. An example of the workflow presented to volunteers is shown
    in Figure \ref{fig:rgz-interface}.

    Since its launch in December 2013, the Radio Galaxy Zoo project has labelled
    over 100~000 radio objects. One particularly notable result is the discovery
    of one of the largest known wide-angled tail AGNs by two volunteers, which
    would be impossible to detect in current automated algorithms
    \citep{banfield16}.

    The Radio Galaxy Zoo dataset contains around 177~000 images from FIRST, and
    2400 images of the CDFS field from ATLAS. The ATLAS images of the ELAIS-S1
    field are not included, and may be used as a testing set for
    cross-identification algorithms trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo in the
    future. Each image is a 2 arcminute-wide square.

    To help reduce noise in the labels, each compact radio object is shown to 5
    volunteers, and each complex radio object is shown to 20 volunteers.

    The labels are stored in a MongoDB database as a collection of associated
    radio objects and the corresponding pixel locations of the volunteers'
    clicks, as well as the right ascension and declination of the radio object.
    The radio and infrared image patches associated with each radio object are
    also included alongside the database.

    For detailed analysis of these labels, see \citet{atlas-ml}.

    In this thesis, we will train machine learning algorithms to perform the
    cross-identification task trained on ATLAS-CDFS labels from the Radio Galaxy
    Zoo.

%     Radio Galaxy Zoo volunteers are first asked to select combinations of
%     radio objects that correspond to one radio source, and are then asked to
%     select the location of the corresponding host galaxy \citep{banfield15}.
%     Each radio subject is labelled by multiple volunteers. These labels are
%     then collated as follows. First, the most common combination of radio
%     objects is selected, and all labels that have a different combination are
%     discarded. This radio combination is called the consensus radio
%     combination. Then, the density of host location labels is estimated using
%     Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE), and the highest density location
%     is selected. This is called the consensus host location. The consensus
%     host location is then matched to the nearest infrared object.

%     An alternative way to find the consensus host location is by using a
%     clustering algorithm such as $k$-means. Host locations are clustered and
%     the cluster containing the most locations is taken to represent the
%     consensus; the consensus location is then the mean of the cluster. This is
%     faster and more robust than using KDE, but requires $k$ to be known. $k$
%     can be estimated using an algorithm such as PG-means \citep{hamerly07} or
%     by choosing $k$ to minimise some information criterion
%     \todo{cite:sklearn}. The consensus labels for the data associated with
%     this thesis were found in this way, fitting a Gaussian mixture model to
%     the host locations with the number of Gaussians chosen to minimise the
%     Bayesian information criterion.

%     Repeated volunteer labelling helps to reduce noise in the labels. This is
%     necessary as the volunteers are not experts, and may incorrectly label the
%     subject. The hope is that the majority of volunteers will correctly label
%     subjects, which seems to be the case for radio subjects where more than
%     75\% of volunteers agree \citep{banfield15}. The number of times a radio
%     subject is shown to different volunteers is called the redundancy. The
%     redundancy is 5 if the subject is a compact source, and 20 for all other
%     sources. These numbers were chosen based on the redundancy levels of the
%     original Galaxy Zoo project [Banfield, personal communication] \todo{Is
%     this how to cite personal communication? Alternatively, is this written
%     down somewhere?}. Since labels with radio combinations that disagree with
%     the consensus are discarded, the redundancy is usually lower in practice
%     when finding the host location. This can lead to very low redundancy input
%     to KDE, causing KDE to fail. This failure can usually be caught, but the
%     existing solution in this case is to take the mean of all host locations.
%     This is not the consensus host location in general. Another effect is that
%     since more complex sources have higher levels of disagreement in the radio
%     combination stage, more complex sources have more discarded volunteer
%     labels, and thus lower redundancy --- so more complex sources have more
%     noise in their labels.
