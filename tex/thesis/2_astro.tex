\chapter{Galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei}
\label{cha:astro}

    Modern astronomy relies on observations of deep space. Telescopes image the
    sky in different wavelengths, with different wavelengths carrying different
    physical meanings. Infrared surveys detect star formation and dust in
    distant galaxies, and radio surveys detect massive objects called active
    galactic nuclei. In this section, we describe what we see when we look at
    the sky in these wavelengths, as well as introducing specific radio and
    infrared surveys relevant to this thesis. We also discuss the motivation
    behind cross-identifying active galactic nuclei with their host galaxies, as
    well as the inherent difficulty in doing so, and hence provide the
    motivation behind this thesis.

    \section{Radio Active Galactic Nuclei}
    \label{sec:agns}

        \begin{figure}[!ht]

            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
                {images/accretion_disk_artist_impression.jpg}
            \caption{An artist's impression of the accretion disk of an active
                galactic nucleus. \emph{Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech}}
            \label{fig:accretion-disk}
        \end{figure}

        Many galaxies contain a supermassive black hole in their centre. These
        black holes accrete matter from the surrounding galaxy in an
        \emph{accretion disk} (Figure \ref{fig:accretion-disk}). The accretion
        process emits huge amounts of light through different physical
        processes. These light-emitting black holes are called active galactic
        nuclei (AGNs). AGNs can be extremely bright, emitting up to $10^{39}$ J
        of energy every second --- nearly a thousand times more energy than our
        entire galaxy emits \citep{begelman84}. AGNs are found throughout the
        universe: The closest known AGN is Centaurus A (shown in Figure
        \ref{fig:centaurus-a}), with $z \approx 0.0018$, and AGNs have been
        detected up to redshifts of $z \approx 7$ \citeme.

        \begin{figure}[!ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]
                {images/ESO_Centaurus_A_LABOCA.jpg}
            \caption{Centaurus A, a relatively close radio active galactic
                nucleus. \emph{Image: ESO/WFI (Optical); MPIfR/ESO/APEX/A.Weiss
                et al. (Submillimetre); NASA/CXC/CfA/R.Kraft et al. (X-ray)}}
            \label{fig:centaurus-a}
        \end{figure}

        AGNs produce \emph{jets} from their accretion disk. Jets are long, thin
        streams of matter such as the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:m87}. These
        jets can be very long, with ``giant'' AGNs emitting jets nearly 1 Mpc in
        length \citep{saripalli05}. The process through which jets are emitted
        is currently unknown \citeme.

        \begin{figure}[!ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/M87_jet.jpg}
            \caption{M87, a giant elliptical galaxy with a jet. \emph{Image:
                NASA and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)}}
            \label{fig:m87}
        \end{figure}

        Electrons in jets can produce \emph{synchrotron radiation}, a form of
        radiation emitted by charged particles as they accelerate at
        relativistic speeds in a magnetic field \citeme. This
        radiation is emitted in radio wavelengths, and so AGNs emitting this
        kind of radiation are called \emph{radio AGNs}. As radio AGNs are the
        focus of this thesis, from this point on ``AGN'' will refer only to
        radio AGNs.

        To fully understand these objects, astronomers need data from more than
        just radio surveys. Combining observations of objects in multiple
        wavelengths is thus a common problem in astronomy, and is called
        \emph{cross-identification} \citep{fan15}. For point sources of light,
        this can be straightforward --- the coordinates of each source on the
        sky are well-known and can often be immediately matched throughout
        surveys --- but as we can only observe AGNs by observing their jets,
        AGNs are effectively not point sources. We discuss this in detail in
        Section \ref{sec:radio-cross-identification}.

    \section{Astronomical Observations}
    \label{sec:astronomical-observations}

        When observing the sky, we can think about the sky as a spherical
        surface surrounding the earth. All objects we see with telescopes are
        flat on the sky, and we only have limited tools to determine their
        distances and scales. In this section, we describe the coordinate
        systems and units used to describe these objects.

        \subsection{Astronomical Coordinates}
        \label{sec:coordinates}

            Astronomy uses a coordinate system called the \emph{equatorial
            coordinate system} to describe the positions of objects on the sky.
            Each position on the sky is described by two numbers: the
            \emph{right ascension} (RA) and the \emph{declination} (dec).

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/ra-dec}
                \caption{The equatorial coordinate system.}
                \label{fig:equatorial-coordinates}
            \end{figure}

            The right ascension of an object is the angle eastward from the
            vernal equinox to the object along the celestial equator. It is
            measured in hours (h), minutes (min), and seconds (s). There are 60
            seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 1 hour is equal to 15
            degrees. Right ascension ranges between 0h and 24h, where both 0h
            and 24h are located at the vernal equinox. The declination of an
            object is the angle northward from the celestial equator to the
            object. It is measured in degrees (${}^\circ$), arcminutes ($'$),
            and arcseconds ($"$). Declination ranges between $-90^\circ$ and
            $90^\circ$, where $-90^\circ$ is the declination of the south
            celestial pole and $90^\circ$ is the declination of the north
            celestial pole. The right ascension and declination are shown in
            Figure \ref{fig:equatorial-coordinates}. It is important to note
            that while right ascension and declination are both measured in
            minutes and seconds, these are \emph{different} minutes and seconds.
            1 minute (right ascension) is equal to 15 arcminutes (declination).

            Objects are usually given a International Astronomical Union (IAU)
            name based on their coordinates. This name includes the catalogue
            that identified the object, the right ascension, and the
            declination. For example, ATLAS3 J002925.7-440256C is from the third
            release of the ATLAS catalogue, and is located at 00h 29m 25.7s
            $-44^\circ$ $02'$ $56"$.

        \subsection{Wavelength and Frequency}
        \label{sec:wavelength}

            \emph{Wavelength} is a property of radiation corresponding to its
            colour. Wavelength is measured in metres (m) and is usually denoted $\lambda$. Ranges of wavelengths are given common names such as
            infrared, optical, and radio.

            When objects emit radiation, the wavelength of the emitted radiation
            depends on the process by which it was emitted. For example, thermal
            radiation is emitted by all objects based entirely on the
            temperature of the object, with hotter objects emitting light with
            shorter wavelengths. Another example is synchrotron radiation
            (Section \ref{sec:agns}), which is emitted in radio wavelengths.

            Since telescopes generally only detect brightnesses of objects in
            the sky, and different wavelengths of radiation require different
            mechanisms to detect, telescopes are designed to measure radiation
            only at specific ranges of wavelengths. Separate measurements of
            wavelength are later combined for analysis.

            \emph{Frequency} is another common property of radiation. It is
            measured in hertz (Hz) and usually denoted $\nu$. Wavelength and
            frequency are interchangeable using the formula
            \[
                c = \lambda \nu
            \]
            where $c$ is the speed of light.

        \subsection{Flux and Magnitude}

            The \emph{flux density} $f$ of an object is its energy output per
            unit time per unit area, and is measured in $\text{W m}^{-2}$. The
            flux density is given by
            \[
                f = \frac{1}{A}\frac{\text{d}E}{\text{d}t}
            \]
            We cannot usually measure the flux over all frequencies, so usually
            flux is observed over a specific frequency range $\Delta \nu$. The
            \emph{spectral flux density} is then the limit of this as the
            frequency range approaches zero, i.e.
            \[
                f_\nu = \frac{1}{A}\frac{\text{d}^2E}{\text{d}\nu\text{d}t}
            \]
            where $E$ is the energy received from the object, $A$ is the area of
            the object on the sky, and $\nu$ is the frequency. The spectral flux
            density is measured in janskys (Jy), an astronomical unit equal to
            $10^{-26} \text{ W m}^{-2} \text{ Hz}^{-1}$ \citep{francis08}.

            The \emph{apparent magitude} $m$ of an object is a logarithmic
            measure of its apparent brightness seen from Earth, relative to the
            star Vega \citep{francis08}. The difference between the magnitudes
            of two objects represents the ratio of their flux densities
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq:magnitude-difference}
                m_2 - m_1 = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_2}{f_1}\right)
            \end{equation}
            and so the apparent magnitude is given by
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq:apparent-magnitude}
                m = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f}{f_{\text{Vega}}}\right)
            \end{equation}
            where $f$ is the flux density of the object and $f_{\text{Vega}}$ is
            the flux density of Vega, measured at the same frequency.

    \section{Radio Surveys}
    \label{sec:radio-surveys}

        A \emph{survey} is an image of the sky made with repeated observations
        in specific wavelengths, aiming to comprehensively cover some large area
        of the sky. In this section we look at EMU and ATLAS, two surveys in
        radio wavelengths that are relevant to this thesis.

        \begin{figure}[!ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/skymap.pdf}
            \caption{A map of the sky, showing the FIRST and EMU radio surveys,
                and the WISE and SWIRE infrared surveys. The ATLAS radio survey
                covers both the CDFS and ELAIS-S1 fields.}
        \end{figure}

        \subsection{EMU: Evolutionary Map of the Universe}
        \label{sec:emu}

            The largest existing radio survey is currently the NRAO VLA Sky
            Survey (NVSS) \citep{condon98}, which covered the entire northern
            sky as far south as $-40^\circ$. However, NVSS is very shallow, only
            detecting objects brighter than $2.5$ mJy, and only resolving
            objects to $45''$. The deepest existing radio survey is of the SWIRE
            fields \citep{owen08}, which only covered around $0.1$ deg$^2$ of
            the sky, but to a depth of $0.015$ mJy with an angular resolution of
            $1.6''$. The Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) is an upcoming
            deep radio survey that aims to provide both deep and wide coverage
            of the radio sky \citep{norris11}. EMU will be sensitive to objects
            to around $0.015$ mJy with an angular resolution of around $10''$,
            and cover the entire southern sky as far north as $30^\circ$. The
            survey is expected to find huge numbers of radio objects --- while
            ATLAS (Section \ref{sec:atlas}) has detected around 4000 radio
            objects, EMU is expected to find \emph{70 million} \citep{banfield15}. Such large
            numbers of radio objects make analysis of the data considerably more
            difficult than analysis of existing surveys has been. Analysis of
            EMU is far too large to be done by hand, and as such will require
            algorithms to process the data. With such large numbers of new
            objects, it is likely that many objects will not fit existing
            models, meaning that model-based approaches to data processing may
            be ineffective. It is this problem that motivates the development of
            new, machine-learned algorithms for processing astronomical data at
            these large scales. While the EMU survey data is not yet released,
            development of such algorithms can begin by looking at other
            datasets with similar sensitivity and resolution, such as ATLAS
            (Section \ref{sec:atlas}).

            EMU aims to fulfil a number of scientific goals, including:
            \begin{itemize}
                \setlength\itemsep{0 pt}
                \item investigating the evolution of galaxies and supermassive
                    black holes,
                \item exploring the large-scale structure and cosmology of the
                    universe,
                \item developing a catalogue of radio objects in the southern
                    sky,
                \item looking for never-before-seen astronomical objects, and
                \item testing strategies for dealing with data from the upcoming
                    Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope.
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{ATLAS: The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey}
        \label{sec:atlas}

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
              \centering
              \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,]{images/CDFS_bitmap}
              \caption{ATLAS observations of CDFS. Reproduced from \citet{franzen15}.}.
              \label{fig:cdfs}
            \end{figure}

            The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) is a deep survey
            of two small areas of the sky in radio wavelengths, which aims to
            help understand the evolution of early galaxies \citep{norris06}.
            The Australia Telescope Compact Array was used to image the Chandra
            Deep Field South (CDFS) and the European Large Area ISO Survey -
            South 1 (ELAIS-S1) fields. These fields are areas of the sky with
            few nearby objects, meaning that observations in these fields are of
            very old, distant objects. These fields were chosen because they are
            the two fields imaged in the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared
            Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE, Section \ref{sec:swire}) visible from
            the southern hemisphere. SWIRE produced high-resolution infrared
            images of its fields, allowing all objects detected in the ATLAS
            radio images to be cross-identified with their infrared
            counterparts.

            ATLAS is considered a pilot survey for EMU. EMU and ATLAS image the
            same wavelengths with similar resolution and sensitivity, so tools
            and methods developed to process and interpret ATLAS data are
            expected to work well on the data produced by EMU.

            ATLAS provides both a catalogue of detected radio objects and a
            radio image of the CDFS and ELAIS-S1 fields. The CDFS image covers a
            total area of 3.7 deg$^2$ and the ELAIS-S1 image covers a total area
            of 2.7 deg$^2$. The CDFS image is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cdfs}.
            The catalogue is a list of all objects detected in the images with a
            peak or integrated flux more than 5 times the background noise
            levels. Each object has an associated survey identifier, an IAU
            name, a position on the sky of the peak flux, a peak flux density,
            an integrated flux density, an angular size, whether the object is
            extended or compact, and a spectral index, as well as uncertainties
            associated with each measurement \citep{franzen15}.

    \section{Infrared Surveys}
    \label{sec:infrared-surveys}

        \subsection{WISE: Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}
        \label{sec:wise}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item WISE is an all-sky survey
                \item Resolution, sensitivity
                \item Purpose
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{SWIRE: Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey}
        \label{sec:swire}

            The Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) is a survey of seven fields of the sky in infrared and wavelengths \citep{lonsdale03}. These fields --- ELAIS-S1, ELAIS-N1, ELAIS-N2, Lockman, CDFS, and Lonsdale --- are called the \emph{SWIRE fields}, totalling 63.2 $\deg^2$ in area. ELAIS-S1 and CDFS are in the southern sky; all other fields are in the northern sky.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item SWIRE is a narrow survey with high resolution
                \item SWIRE fields
                \item Resolution, sensitivity
                \item Purpose
                \item Compare to WISE
            \end{itemize}

    \section{Radio Cross-identification}
    \label{sec:radio-cross-identification}

        \subsection{Motivation}
        \label{sec:cross-identification-motivation}

        The main goal of cross-
        identifying AGNs is to better understand the relationship between AGNs
        and star-forming activity in their host galaxies \citep{norris06}.

        While we cannot observe the black holes of AGNs directly, we can observe
        the radio emissions from their jets. These could then be matched to the
        galaxies hosting the black holes, allowing us to learn more about the
        galaxy, the black hole, and the surrounding environment. These host
        galaxies are not visible in radio wavelengths,

        \subsection{Norris et al. Catalogue}
        \label{sec:norris}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Norris provided a catalogue of cross-identifications
                \item The catalogue is ``expert'' data, so sorted through by actual astronomers
                \item The catalogue contains the names and locations of each component and matches them to the corresponding SWIRE objects
                \item The catalogue also contains the flux associated with the SWIRE object
                \item Estimated $9.02\%$ false cross-identifications
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Fan et al. Catalogue}
        \label{sec:fan}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Bayesian hypothesis testing to fit models to the ATLAS catalogue
                \item Doesn't detect IR sources not in catalogue
                \item Matches within 2'
                \item Matched 564 radio objects identically to Norris, missed 31 Norris identified, and identified an additional 62
            \end{itemize}

    \section{Radio Galaxy Zoo}
    \label{sec:radio-galaxy-zoo}

        \begin{itemize}
            % \item The Norris catalogue is manual expert classifications, which scales terribly (especially for EMU)
            % \item The Fan catalogue is model-based, so might miss things that are unusual
            % \item Radio Galaxy Zoo is an attempt to generate a catalogue of cross-identifications for the ATLAS and FIRST surveys using crowdsourcing
            % \item This is an example of citizen science, see also Lintott et al. Galaxy Zoo
            % \item Aims to have non-experts classify radio objects \cite{norris16}
            % \item 20 classifications for complex objects, 5 for compact \cite{banfield15}
            \item Launched in December 2013
            \item Resulted in x cross-identifications of FIRST and ATLAS
            \item Brief description of how it works
            \item Citizen scientists also found one of the largest known WATs \cite{banfield16}
            \item The plan is to use RGZ as a training set for next-generation cross-identification and classification algorithms
        \end{itemize}

    The \citeauthor{norris06} catalogue is highly accurate, but manual expert
    cross-identification of radio surveys is impractical for large surveys. The
    CDFS field examined by \citeauthor{norris06} only contains around 2400 radio
    objects, which is small even compared to existing surveys --- FIRST
    \citep{becker95} found 946 000 radio sources, and EMU is expected to find 70
    million. Automated algorithms such as \citeauthor{fan15} scale better, but
    most such algorithms are still in their infancy \citeauthor{norris16} and
    many are model-based, potentially missing many sources that do not fit the
    models. The Radio Galaxy Zoo project \citep{banfield15} provides a different
    approach: Allow many non-expert volunteers to manually cross-identify radio
    sources with their infrared host galaxies.

    Radio Galaxy Zoo is a website where volunteers are presented with a radio
    image from ATLAS or FIRST and a corresponding infrared image from SWIRE or
    WISE, and are tasked with matching the radio source with its host galaxy, as
    well as identifying which radio objects are associated with the same host
    galaxy (e.g., two radio objects may represent two jets of one AGN). While
    both the cross-identification task and the radio object association task are
    astronomically interesting, we focus only on the cross-identification task
    for this thesis. An example of the workflow presented to volunteers is shown
    in Figure \ref{fig:rgz-interface}.

    Since its launch in December 2013, the Radio Galaxy Zoo project has labelled over 100 000 radio objects. One particularly notable result is the discovery of one of the largest known wide-angled tail AGNs by two citizen scientists, which would be impossible to detect in current automated algorithms \citep{banfield16}.

    The Radio Galaxy Zoo dataset contains around 177 000 images from FIRST, and
    2400 images of the CDFS field from ATLAS. The ATLAS images of the ELAIS-S1
    field are not included, and may be used as a testing set for cross-
    identification algorithms trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo in the future. Each image is a 2 arcminute-wide square.

    To help reduce noise in the labels, each compact radio object is shown to 5
    volunteers, and each complex radio object is shown to 20 volunteers.

    The labels are stored in a MongoDB database as a collection of associated
    radio objects and the corresponding pixel locations that volunteers clicked
    on, as well as the right ascension and declination of the radio object. The
    radio and infrared image patches associated with each radio object are also
    included alongside the database.

    In this thesis, we will train machine learning algorithms to perform the
    cross-identification task trained on ATLAS-CDFS labels from the Radio Galaxy
    Zoo.

%     Radio Galaxy Zoo volunteers are first asked to select combinations of
%     radio objects that correspond to one radio source, and are then asked to
%     select the location of the corresponding host galaxy \citep{banfield15}.
%     Each radio subject is labelled by multiple volunteers. These labels are
%     then collated as follows. First, the most common combination of radio
%     objects is selected, and all labels that have a different combination are
%     discarded. This radio combination is called the consensus radio
%     combination. Then, the density of host location labels is estimated using
%     Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE), and the highest density location
%     is selected. This is called the consensus host location. The consensus
%     host location is then matched to the nearest infrared object.

%     An alternative way to find the consensus host location is by using a
%     clustering algorithm such as $k$-means. Host locations are clustered and
%     the cluster containing the most locations is taken to represent the
%     consensus; the consensus location is then the mean of the cluster. This is
%     faster and more robust than using KDE, but requires $k$ to be known. $k$
%     can be estimated using an algorithm such as PG-means \citep{hamerly07} or
%     by choosing $k$ to minimise some information criterion
%     \todo{cite:sklearn}. The consensus labels for the data associated with
%     this thesis were found in this way, fitting a Gaussian mixture model to
%     the host locations with the number of Gaussians chosen to minimise the
%     Bayesian information criterion.

%     Repeated volunteer labelling helps to reduce noise in the labels. This is
%     necessary as the volunteers are not experts, and may incorrectly label the
%     subject. The hope is that the majority of volunteers will correctly label
%     subjects, which seems to be the case for radio subjects where more than
%     75\% of volunteers agree \citep{banfield15}. The number of times a radio
%     subject is shown to different volunteers is called the redundancy. The
%     redundancy is 5 if the subject is a compact source, and 20 for all other
%     sources. These numbers were chosen based on the redundancy levels of the
%     original Galaxy Zoo project [Banfield, personal communication] \todo{Is
%     this how to cite personal communication? Alternatively, is this written
%     down somewhere?}. Since labels with radio combinations that disagree with
%     the consensus are discarded, the redundancy is usually lower in practice
%     when finding the host location. This can lead to very low redundancy input
%     to KDE, causing KDE to fail. This failure can usually be caught, but the
%     existing solution in this case is to take the mean of all host locations.
%     This is not the consensus host location in general. Another effect is that
%     since more complex sources have higher levels of disagreement in the radio
%     combination stage, more complex sources have more discarded volunteer
%     labels, and thus lower redundancy --- so more complex sources have more
%     noise in their labels.
