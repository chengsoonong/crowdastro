\appendix
\chapter{Crowdastro Package}

As part of this thesis, I developed an open source Python package called
\emph{crowdastro}, containing methods for machine learning on the cross-
identification task, and implementations of many of the methods described here.
In this appendix, I briefly describe how to obtain this package, and list the
submodules available.

\section{Obtaining Crowdastro}

    The source for crowdastro is available on GitHub at
    \url{http://github.com/chengsoonong/crowdastro}. Crowdastro can also be
    installed through pip, by running \texttt{pip3 install crowdastro}. The code
    is MIT licensed.

    \todo{List submodules.}

    \subsection{crowdastro.crowd.raykar}
        \label{sec:crowdastro-raykar}

        \texttt{crowdastro.crowd.raykar} is an implementation of the crowd
        learning algorithm developed by \citet{raykar10}, described here in
        \Section \ref{sec:raykar}. The module provides a
        \texttt{RaykarClassifier} object which implements a modified scikit-
        learn interface.
