\chapter{The First Experiment}
\label{cha:firstexp}

\section{Why I Did It}
\label{sec:why1}

\section{What I Did}
\label{sec:what1}

We add a few blank pages here to illustrate section
headings\index{Section~headings} on odd
pages (other than the first page in a new chapter).

Also, here is an example of a citation~\cite{lamport94}, and another
one~\cite{knuth86}, and another~\cite{goossens94}.  If in the context,
it makes sense to talk about the work of an author in a more
integrated way, like \citeN{lamport94}, that can be done
too\index{Books~to~read|textbf}.  Because the information on this page
is \emph{so} important, it has been indexed too (see the index at the
back of this thesis).\footnote{However, it is \emph{strongly}
  advisable to leave indexing until the thesis is complete.  Donald
  Knuth says to allow about a day for the task of indexing.  In my
  experience he was spot-on.}
