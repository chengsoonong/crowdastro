    "The ATLAS dataset consists of images of the radio sky in two fields, CDFS and ELAIS-S1, as well as a catalogue of objects in these fields. Unfortunately, the identifiers of the images and the identifiers in the catalogue are *different*, so we cannot rely on them matching (in fact, they don't match *at all*). The ATLAS catalogue identifiers correspond to nothing I've found so far, but the CDFS/ELAIS-S1 identifiers correspond to the image names, the Galaxy Zoo: Radio Talk survey IDs, and the radio subjects' `source` field in the Radio Galaxy Zoo dataset. There's a catalogue associated with the images, but it doesn't include the ATLAS names.\n",

    "Each object in the dataset is called a \"radio component\" and the $2' \\times 2'$ patch of radio sky centred on each component is called a \"radio subject\". There are $2461$ CDFS component and $1935$ ELAIS-S1 component.\n",
